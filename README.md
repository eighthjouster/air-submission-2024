### Some post-development notes

#### Pending tasks

These task were not implemented in the exercise, but should be in a real-world application:

- GZipping the requests / responses.
- Authorization.
- Check for network fetching errors.
- Handling of custom headers (e.g. `x-air-board-context`.)
- Api Url in a configuration constant: `https://api.air.inc`
- Better state management. Either use `useReduce()` or the Redux library.
- Scoped CSS/SCSS styles.
- Make the Asset component media type-aware.
- Styling to reflect the appearance of the reference application.
- Click and navigate.
- Security and resilience.
- Unit / integration / e2e testings.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
